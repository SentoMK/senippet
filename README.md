## Detailed Instructions

### Adding a Code Snippet/Template

After selecting `1. Add Snippet/Template`, you will be prompted to enter the title, content, and tags in sequence. Separate tags with commas.

### Listing Code Snippets/Templates

After selecting `2. List Snippets/Templates`, all saved code snippets/templates will be listed, including the index, title, and tags.

### Searching by Tag

After selecting `3. Search by Tag`, enter the tag you want to search for. The program will display all code snippets/templates containing that tag.

### Editing a Code Snippet/Template

After selecting `4. Edit Snippets/Templates`, all code snippets/templates will be listed. Enter the index of the code snippet/template to edit (multiple indices can be separated by commas). You can then modify the title, content, and tags of each code snippet/template. If you do not want to modify a field, simply press Enter to keep the original value.

### Deleting Code Snippets/Templates

After selecting `5. Delete Snippets/Templates`, all code snippets/templates will be listed. Enter the index of the code snippet/template to delete (multiple indices can be separated by commas). The program will delete the specified code snippets/templates.

### Showing the Data Path

After selecting `6. Show Data Path`, the path to the directory where code snippet/template data is stored will be displayed. You can find the JSON file storing the code snippets/templates in this directory.

## Configuration File

Code snippet/template data is stored in a JSON file. This file is located in the following directory:

- `Linux: $HOME/.local/share/senprompt/data`

- `macOS: $HOME/Library/Application Support/com.sentomk.senprompt/data`

- `Windows: C:\Users\<Your User>\AppData\Roaming\sentomk\senprompt\data`
